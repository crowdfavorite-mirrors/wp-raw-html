Lets you use raw HTML or any other code in your posts. You can also disable smart quotes and other automatic formatting on a per-post basis.

== Description ==

Lets you disable automatic formatting like smart quotes and automatic paragraphs, and use raw HTML/JS/CSS code in your posts without WordPress messing it up.

The free version only works with the HTML editor. Get the Pro Version if you want to be able to switch between HTML and the Visual editor without WordPress messing up your content.

**Features**

With this plugin, you can wrap any part of your post in [raw]...[/raw] tags to prevent WordPress from converting newlines to HTML paragraphs, replacing apostrophes with typographic quotes and so on. This is very useful if you need to add a CSS block or JavaScript to your post.

RawHTML will also add some new checkboxes to the "Edit" screen that let you disable certain WP filters on a per-post basis. This way you can : 

* Disable wptexturize (the function that creates smart quotes and other typographic characters).
* Disable automatic paragraph creation.
* Disable image smilies. 
* Disable convert_chars (the function that converts ampersands to HTML entities and "fixes" some Unicode characters).

**Usage**

To prevent a part of your post or page from being filtered by WordPress, wrap it in `[raw]...[/raw]` or `<!--raw-->...<!--/raw-->` tags. These two versions work exactly the same, except that the latter won't be visible to your visitors even if you deactivate Raw HTML.

*Example :*

`<!--raw-->
This 

is 

a "test"!
<!--/raw-->`

In this case, the tags will prevent WordPress from inserting paragraph breaks between "This", "is" and "a "test"", as well as ensure that the double quotes arround "test" are not converted to typographic (curly) quotes.

**Notes**

Personally, I prefer the `<!--raw-->...<!--/raw-->` syntax. These tags are formed as HTML comments, which means they won't be visible to your visitors even if you deactivate the Raw HTML plugin. On the other hand. the `[raw]...[/raw]` tags would show up.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin follow these steps :

1. Download the raw-html.zip file to your local machine.
1. Unzip the file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I set some of the "Disable xyz" tweaks to be "On" by default? =

Open to the post editor and click the "Screen Options" button in the top-right part of the page. A settings panel will appear. Locate the "Raw HTML defaults" section and tick the appropriate checkboxes. Any changes you make to these settings will only affect new and edited posts.
